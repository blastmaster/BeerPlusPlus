* write test for BeerPlusPlus::Database with multiple threads/processes due to
  the parallelism of the Mojo webserver. assumed is an unexpected behavior if
  through two user-objects the store-subroutine is called but due to the single
  instance of the database the bug could may be created while a race condition
  between processes[ok?]/threads[bad] (i.e. through the store-subroutine; see
  that subroutine for a detailed description of precise location on the assumed
  bug)

* BeerPlusPlus::Database

  * carp if DATADIR does not exist!
  * if store does not exist and init-attribute is set to false $db->exists(...)
    returns always false even if store was initialized manually after startup
